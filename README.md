## Tigr: Transforming Irregular Graphs for GPU-Friendly Graph Processing

Tigr is a lightweight graph transformation and processing framework for GPU platforms. 

In real-world graphs, the high irregularity of degree distribution acts
as a major barrier to their efficient processing on GPU architectures.
Tigr addresses the irregularity issue at its origin by transforming 
irregular graphs into more regular ones, meanwhile preserving the same
results as running on the original graphs.

The code is under final testing, and will be released soon.
