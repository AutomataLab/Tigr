# Tigr: Transforming Irregular Graphs for GPU-Friendly Graph Processing
Tigr is a CUDA lightweight grah processing framework for the GPU. In real-world graphs, the high irregularity of degree distribution acts as a major barrier to their efficient processing on GPU architectures. Tigr proposes to address the irregularity issue at its origin by transforming irregular graphs into more regular ones. We are preparing the codes ready to publish.
